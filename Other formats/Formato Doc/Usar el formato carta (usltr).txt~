Submitted papers must present original research results or relevant experience reports, and should not be published or under evaluation for other conferences and/or journals. An article can be sent to only one symposium or associated event. Submitting the same article to several symposia or associated events will be basis for rejection.

If the submissions are written in Spanish or Portuguese, they should have an abstract in English. Submitted papers must be formatted according to IEEE standard (Manuscript Templates for Conference Proceedings).
Submitted papers must be substantial intellectual contributions of the authors and follow practices to avoid plagiarism as set out in the Operations Manual for Services and Products Publication of IEEE.
The final program and the proceedings will only include papers with at least one author registered in the AUTHOR category of the conference before final version submission deadline.
A selection of the best papers accepted and presented at the symposia of CLEI 2014 will be proposed for publication in selected journals such as CLEI Electronic Journal  and Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science. Invited authors must submit an improved and expanded version of the article in English that will undergo a new evaluation process.
Only papers accepted and presented at the symposia of CLEI 2014 will be indexed and published by IEEE Xplorer digital library (pending).
